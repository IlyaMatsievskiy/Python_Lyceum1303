# Interesting Assignments from High School

This repository contains some of the interesting assignments I worked on during my time in high school. These projects allowed me to explore various concepts in computer science and data structures, including:

- **Graph Theory**: Implementation of algorithms for working with graphs, such as traversals, shortest path finding, and various graph representations.
  
- **Topological Sorting**: Developing and implementing algorithms to find a valid topological ordering.

- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms to determine the minimum distance between two vertices in a graph, such as Dijkstra's.

- **Binary Heap**: Learning about and implementing binary heaps, which are efficient structures for priority queues and are used in various optimization algorithms.

- **Model Training**: An introduction to basic machine learning concepts, focusing on how models are trained and evaluated for performance.
